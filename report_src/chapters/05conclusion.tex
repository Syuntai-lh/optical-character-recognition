It's the authors opinion that the weakest part of the OCR system is the
character detection. Some letters are recognized poorly due to that fact that
our training data consists of pictures with white letters on black background
and vice versa. This might have led our classifier to classify purely white images as a
character, usually the character `i'.

The strongest part of our OCR system is the character classification. The
SVM classifier achieves an error rate of \vari{error_matlab}, which is quite
sufficient for the given task.

Due to lack of time, the authors didn't have time to improve the system further.
The authors have gained a lot of experience with relevant machine learning
libraries such as scikit-learn for python and the machine learning toolbox for
matlab.
